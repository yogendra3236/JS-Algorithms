# JS-Algorithms

In this project, I have solved some of the logical questions from CodeSignal, Hackerrank and FreeCodeCamp. 

## Requirements

### Node

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser..
**npm** npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
You can install npm by running the following code in your terminal on Linux.

`sudo apt-get install npm`

### How to run the code?

Navigate to the directory where your `.js` file is located. After that, type `node your_file_name.js` to execute the command.
